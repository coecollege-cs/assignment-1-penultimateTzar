# Questions to ask customers who want us to design a payroll system

* How are employees paid?  
* Do you have hourly or salaried workers?
* How will information be given to the system?  
* Will it be manually, or read from other files?
* Will employees clock in and clock out? 
* Or, will payment be based upon a set schedule?
* If the latter, how do you want schedule changes handled?


## If there are hourly workers:

* How does overtime work?
* Is there weekend pay?
