# Questions to ask customers who want us to design a payroll system

* How many employees?
* How are employees paid?  
* Do they use direct deposit?
* Do you have hourly or salaried workers?
* How will information be given to the system?  
* Will it be manually, or read from other files?
* Coupled with other systems?
* Will employees clock in and clock out? 
* Or, will payment be based upon a set schedule?
* If the latter, how do you want schedule changes handled?
* What currencies will you use?
* Who are the users/what is the security?
* How long should it retain data? Should it archive payroll data?
* What O.S. does it need to run on?
* Will you need to add more levels/groups of pay?
* Will this system handle bonuses?
* What laws/regulations govern this system?

## Special exceptions:

* How will sick days happen?
* Vacation days?
* Pay advancement?
